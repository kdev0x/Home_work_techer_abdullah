# Math module 
there are bunch of commands we  will focuse on we will curntly work on ceill floor trunc and factorial and sqrt hypot
## example
```python
print(math.ceill(3.6)) # the output is 4
print(math.floor(3.6)) # the output is 3
print(math.trunc(3.6)) # the output is 3
print(math.factorial(3) # the output is 6
print(math.sqrt(16)) # the output is 4
print(math.hypot(3,4))
```
### Ceil()
#### ceil always round to the number next to it never down
### floor()
#### floor always round to the number next to it never up
###  trunk() 
#### trunk always remove the decimle point and never rounds up 
### factorial()
#### it multipliyes all numbers smaller then the number example factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 *1
### sqrt
#### is the square root of a number
### hypot
#### when you have a triangle you give it the to smaller angles and it will give you the larger one
